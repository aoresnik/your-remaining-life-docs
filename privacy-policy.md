Privacy Policy
--------------

**Effective Date:** 2025-05-28

**App Name:** Your Remaining Life

**Developer:** Andrej Ore≈°nik

### 1. Overview

We respect your privacy. This app does **not** collect, store, or share
any personal information with us or with third parties. All data you
enter stays on your device.

### 2. Data Collection and Usage

-   The app does **not** collect or transmit any personal data to our
    servers or to third parties.

-   Any data you input, including potentially personal or sensitive
    information, is stored **locally on your device** only.

-   If you use Android's built-in backup services (e.g., Google Backup),
    your app data may be included in device backups. This is managed
    entirely by Android, and we do not have access to this data.

### 3. Third-Party Services

-   We do not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or data
    collection services.

-   No data is shared with any third-party services.

### 4. Data Security

Because all data remains on your device, its protection depends on your
device's own security features (e.g., screen lock, encryption, Android
OS settings). We recommend enabling these features to protect your
information.

### 5. Your Consent

By using the app, you consent to this privacy policy.

### 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
reflected on this page with an updated effective date.

### 7. Crash Reports

If the app crashes, Android may offer you the option to send a crash
report. These reports are managed by Google and may include technical
data such as:

-   Device type and OS version

-   Stack traces and app state at the time of the crash

-   Potential fragments of user-provided data (e.g., dates or text
    input) if they appear in error messages or logs

Crash reports are only sent **with your consent**, and may be shared
with the app developer (us) to diagnose and fix issues. We do not use
this data for any other purpose and do not share it with third parties.
You may choose not to send crash reports by declining the prompt shown
by Android.
